      <h2 id="subtitle2">Why this app is not available for iPhone?</h2>
			<p class="left">I programmed the app using React Native, a framework for building apps. This framework allows you to export the application to different platforms, including iOS.</p>
			<p class="left">Export to iOS requires to be done on an Apple device (due to some required libraries), and sadly, I have not access to an Apple device to do it.</p>
      <p class="left">If you have an apple device, knowledge about exporting React Native applications and want to give me a hand with this topic, do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="subtitle2">Why is not available in the Play Store / Apple Store</h2>
			<p class="left">In order to publish an app in the Play Store / Apple Store you need a Developer Account. In case of Android, Google charges a one time fee of 25€. Apple charges 99€/year for its develop account.</p>
      <p class="left">As I will share this app for free, paying for a developer account doesn't make sense to me right now. Maybe in the future, if I keep developing apps, I will pay for the android one as it is more affordable, but not for now.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="subtitle2">Why are you sharing it for free? Do you make money with it in any way?</h2>
			<p class="left">I created this app just after finishing a React Native course, as a way to put into practice the knowledge I had acquired. I did it in my free time and with no other objective but to learn.</p>
      <p class="left">The app is not monetized in any way: it has no ads, no premium features, no in-app payments. And, something that is not common in today's apps, it does not collect any data from your phone.</p>
      <p class="left">This app has been licensed under a GPLv3 license, and its sources are published in <a href="https://github.com/AngelLM/MandoDisplayApp">this Github Repository</a></p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="subtitle2">I like it! Can I collaborate in any way?</h2>
			<p class="left">Of course you can! You can give me some feedback of the app, share it with people who might be interested and follow me in my social networks!</p>
      <p class="left">And, if you want to, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/angellm/1">you can buy me a coffee</a>, which will help to keep me awake to continue developing projects like this and to keep sharing them for free.</p>
      <p class="left">Thank you very much! ( ^‿^)c[_]</p>
